All right, so -- this is a remix of www.cloudcity.glitch.me!
Here, we're trying out some STAR PATTERNS instead.

TO DO:
-------
- [ ] some of the text overlaps with stars, making it hard to read
- [ ] the color contrast for the stars could be harder (tweak the color values)
- [ ] make it more interesting to interact with -- for example, give the user a constellation name and give them a number of guesses to find the constellation.
- [ ] alternately, show the user the whole constellation but ask them what its name is
- [ ] wrap each constellation in a transparent SVG polygon so that they are more easily clicked
- [ ] provide an illustration of what is represented by each constellation -- illuminate it when the name is shown (on click)
